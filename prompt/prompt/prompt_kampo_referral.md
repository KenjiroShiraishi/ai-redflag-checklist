# Kampo Internal Medicine Referral Checklist

**Purpose:**  
This checklist supports clinicians in organizing reasons for referral to Kampo (Traditional Japanese Medicine) internal medicine **after red flags are excluded**.  
AI is used only to structure and summarize; all final decisions remain with human clinicians.

---

## Input Fields
- Red flags excluded? (Yes/No)  
- Current medications (polypharmacy? Y/N)  
- Symptom control status under standard care (adequate / insufficient)  
- Patient preferences (avoid side effects, natural/holistic approach, integrative care)  
- Symptom cluster (e.g., fatigue, insomnia, coldness, appetite loss, multiple chronic issues)

---

## Output (AI organizes)
- Reasons Kampo referral may be appropriate:
  - "Red flags excluded — no urgent disease suspected"
  - "Polypharmacy concerns: patient already on >3 medications, side-effect risk high"
  - "Insufficient improvement with current Western medical treatment"
  - "Patient preference for natural or integrative approach"
  - "Multiple chronic symptoms may benefit from holistic Kampo-based care"

- Suggested patient message:  
  *"Your condition does not suggest a dangerous disease, but since multiple chronic symptoms remain and you wish to reduce medications, a referral to Kampo internal medicine may provide an additional treatment option."*
