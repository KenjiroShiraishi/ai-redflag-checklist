## Instructions
- For each patient presenting with dizziness/vertigo, check **Yes / No** for the following red flag items.  
- If any item is positive, consider urgent or specialist referral.  
- The AI **only organizes and summarizes information**; it does not diagnose.  
- The final judgment must always be made by the human clinician.

## Red Flag Items

1. **Dizziness with headache or neck pain**  
   → Possible stroke, vertebral artery dissection, intracranial lesion  

2. **Gait ataxia or severe imbalance**  
   → Central vestibular lesion, cerebellar stroke  

3. **Dizziness with loss of consciousness or syncope**  
   → Cardiac arrhythmia, brainstem ischemia  

4. **Focal neurologic deficits** (weakness, diplopia, dysarthria, sensory loss)  
   → Central lesion (brainstem/cerebellum)  

5. **Severe symptoms lasting > 1 hour**  
   → Stroke, vestibular migraine, CNS infection  

6. **Sudden severe vertigo with new-onset hearing loss**  
   → Labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, vascular event  

7. **Elderly patient with systemic risk factors** (anemia, hypotension, polypharmacy, cardiovascular disease)  
   → Higher likelihood of central or multifactorial causes

## AI Output (Prompt Summary)

**Red Flags Detected:**  
- Sudden persistent vertigo → Possible otologic or vascular disorder  

**Additional Referral Triggers:**  
- Symptoms have persisted >1 week without improvement  
- Significant nausea interfering with daily activities  

**Recommended Referral:**  
- Otolaryngology (Neuro-otology)  

**Urgency:**  
- Non-emergent, but early referral recommended  

**Patient Explanation (AI Draft):**  
"Your condition is not life-threatening, but the sudden onset of persistent vertigo may be caused by an inner ear inflammation or other disorder. An ENT specialist evaluation is recommended."  

**Clinician Next Steps:**  
- Refer to ENT, request neurological exam and hearing tests for further evaluation.  

**Final Diagnosis (Physician Report):**  
- ENT physician reported: *"Suspected vestibular neuritis."*
