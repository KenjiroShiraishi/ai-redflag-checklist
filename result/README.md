# result Folder

This folder contains anonymized case logs generated using the **AI-Redflag-Checklist**.  
Each file includes both the **input prompt** and the **AI-generated output**, followed by the final clinical judgment.

---

## 🔒 Anonymization Policy
- All files have been fully anonymized before sharing.  
- Direct identifiers (names, addresses, contact details) were never included.  
- Indirect identifiers (exact ages, surgery years, detailed background information) have been generalized or masked with ●●●.  

---

## 📂 Contents
- Case files are **sequentially numbered without dates** (e.g., `case-1.pdf`, `case-2.pdf`).  
- **Dates and other temporal markers are intentionally omitted** to reduce re-identification risk.  
- 3-,cases includes a **hospital referral** (hypertension detection).

---

## 🧾 Notes
- These files are shared for **transparency and reproducibility** only.  
- AI outputs are used to **structure and organize information**, not to make diagnoses.  
- Final clinical judgment always remains with the human clinician.
