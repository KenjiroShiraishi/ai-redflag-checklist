# Results Folder

This folder contains anonymized case logs generated using the **AI-Redflag-Checklist**.  
Each file includes both the **input prompt** and the **AI-generated output**, followed by the final clinical judgment.  

---

## 🔒 Anonymization Policy
- All files have been fully anonymized before sharing.  
- Direct identifiers (names, addresses, contact details) were never included.  
- Indirect identifiers (exact ages, surgery years, detailed background information) have been generalized or masked with ●●●.  
- Some cases were published with **written patient consent** (explicitly noted in the file).  

---

## 📂 Contents
- Case files are named and dated for transparency (e.g., `case-09-02.pdf`).  
- Each file demonstrates how the red flag checklist and AI-assisted structuring were used in practice.  
- One case includes a **hospital referral** (hypertension detection).  

---

## 🧾 Notes
- These files are shared for **transparency and reproducibility** only.  
- AI outputs are used to **structure and organize information**, not to make diagnoses.  
- Final clinical judgment always remains with the human clinician.
